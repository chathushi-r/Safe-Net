SafeNet is a web application that acts as a malware detection tool for scanning URLS/PE files. Users are allowed to register, login and scan PE files or URLs. The system will then offer the user with aÂ result 
indicating if the PE file/URL is malicious or safe. 
In this implementation, ML classification models are constructed to aid in the processing of the system's two key functionalities: URL scanning and PE file scanning. This application connects to ML models via a Flask API, which allows for URL and PE file scanning. The Python script provides the fundamental scanning functionality, with Flask serving as the intermediary for communication between the web backend and the ML models. In addition, a database is connected that will store all the user details and scanned history of PE files/URLs.

This application will allow the user to signup and login as a client/admin. Thereafter, the user will be directed to a dashboard that will consist of user details, user history and the options to upload urls/PE files for scanning.
After a PE file/url is uploaded for a scan, the system provides a result whether the it is malicious/benign.
If the PE file/url is malicious, the system provides the following details:
- Timestamp of the scan
- General safety recommendations on how to handle malicious files/urls
- General information resources for the user to gain some understanding on malicious files/urls.
If the PE file/url is benign:
- Timestamp of the scan
- For a safe url, a clickable link to direct to that uploaded safe url.
- PE file features and URL features
